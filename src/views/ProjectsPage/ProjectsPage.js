            To build this website I have switched the main framework to MaterialUI as it is more popular and gives more tools than Material Design Lite. 
            I am glad that you are reading this project's description. Have a nice day! ðŸ˜ƒ"

            projectDescription="It was a quick project, where I didn't need to think about a design. The main goal was to improve elements positioning, replace images with text to a real containers with pictures. At the end I've focused on websites speed. The old version is hosted on a slow server, if we add to it bunch of low quality pictures instead of text, we get a website where average loading time is about 10s. That is mad! In my version, the image size is matched to the screen size, which translates into an average loading time of less than 1 second.

            Also, with this project I've improved my repository organising style thanks to free Material UI templates. I tried to style the website with SCSS, but eventually I've decided it won't be useful for such a small project.
            I know my design skills are not the best, I design websites in a way I find them nice and easy to read. I hope you like it."

            Final product delivers an App in a script, as well as complete installer to install the app on Windows machines. With this App you can visualise data from 2 different sources, present it frame by frame with colour blindness adjustments and export a video in various resolution."

            projectDescription="The projects started when a friend of mine aske me if I could make a website where he could collect orders from customers for his pizza place. I'm not experienced enough to deliver a fully functional online shop with payment gates, but then I realised, it could be a great project for my portfolio.
            A project, that combines 2 programming langueages and is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. I didn't know much about backend programming in Python and I had a little bit of experience in React. I started with some videos on YouTube, about a blog made in Django. It helped me to implement a user registration procedure and from now on a new user could register into my remote database on GCP. The next step was to add JavaScript to the project. I started with a simple UI with some dummy data, just to have a basic interface (homepage, user profile and different navbars for logged in users. When it's been done I realised I need to use Redux to connect backend with fronted.
            The final result was a website with simple CMS, where an admin could insert new offers onto homepage and new users could login and see their profiles.

            it renders a button with with a value passed in props. When button is clicked, it triggers a function passed also in props.
            The function puts the next value (X or O) inside of the square. The Board collects squares and displays them in right order.
            Game.js is responsible for game's logic, game needs only 3 methods: handleClick(), jumpTo() and renderMoves(). 
            HandleClick handles whose turn is now and services game's history. JumpTo() switches between steps that have been made. 
            RenderMoves() renders game's history, allowing user to go step back. "

          We had to keep the highest standard of project development, providing project documentation, unit and acceptance testing. 
          In the project we have used Node.js, Handlebars with Koa.js framework (newer Express.js) keeping the standard of ES6. 
          The project taught me a lot about working in a team, especially how to assing tasks, how to deal with delays 
          and how help others if they face a problem. For example we have used GitHub Project Issues to manage tasks previously discussed on MS Teams or What'sApp."

            projectDescription="After a few other projects, I have decided to upgrade my online portfolio. The previous version was too messed up to update it, but it was my first project in ReactJS and I'm keeping so I could see future progress. 
            To build this website I have switched the main framework to MaterialUI as it is more popular and gives more tools than Material Design Lite. 
            I am glad that you are reading this project's description. Have a nice day! ðŸ˜ƒ"
